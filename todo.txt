Requirements:
Wishlist Product Updates and Removal Notifications: All users should be notified if a product in their wishlist is updated or removed.
Wishlist Add Notifications: Product owners should be notified when other users add their products to their wishlist.
Profile View Notifications: Premium users receive full notifications about who viewed their profile. Gold users get a notification without user details. Standard users do not receive profile view notifications.
Non-logged-in Users: They can browse products but can't add products to their wishlist, chat, or add products.
Implementation Plan (Strategy Pattern and Observer Pattern):
Strategy Pattern for Notifications: We will use the strategy pattern to manage notifications for profile views based on user tiers.
Notification Service: Implement methods to handle different notification scenarios (wishlist updates/removals, wishlist adds, and profile views).
Event System: Trigger notifications using an event-driven approach (e.g., calling methods in the ProductService or UserService).
Update Services: Modify ProductService and UserService to emit notifications when specific events occur.

chat:
1. users can chat with each other about product. (chat on product or regular messanger?)
2. afitr implementing chat - make it so if a owner edit a product, all the wishlistUsers will get notify. (price)

userTier:
1. gold and platinum users can see who are the users that has thier products in a wishlist. standard users can only see the number of users for each product.`
